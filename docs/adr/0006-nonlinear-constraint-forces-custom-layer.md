# ADR-0006: `NonlinearConstraint` forces the custom acquisition layer, with a warning

**Status:** Accepted (implemented in Phase 2)
**Date:** 2026-09-23
**Deciders:** [project owner]

## Context

FR17 (a feasibility constraint across parameters expressed as an arbitrary expression, e.g.
`var * x ** z <= n`) cannot be expressed through Ax's own `parameter_constraints`, confirmed
linear-only. BoTorch's `optimize_acqf` supports it directly via
`nonlinear_inequality_constraints`, but only within `boptim`'s own custom acquisition layer
(`PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md` section 4.3), not Ax's default generation strategy (FR4).
`BayesianOptimizer.ask()` with `alpha=None` normally means "use the default strategy".

## Decision

When `SearchSpace` contains one or more `NonlinearConstraint` and `ask()` is called with
`alpha=None`, `boptim` automatically switches to its own custom acquisition layer instead of
Ax's default strategy, forcing `alpha` to a fixed default (`DEFAULT_ALPHA_WHEN_FORCED = 0.0`),
and logs a warning stating that the switch happened and why. `alpha` passed explicitly already
uses the custom layer, so no switch or warning is needed in that case.

## Options considered

| Option | Description | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Silently ignore the constraint on the default path | `ask(alpha=None)` behaves exactly as it would without the `NonlinearConstraint` present | Simplest, but silently returns candidates that may violate a constraint the caller explicitly declared: a correctness bug wearing a "no manual tuning needed" feature's clothes |
| Raise an error instead of switching | `ask(alpha=None)` raises if a `NonlinearConstraint` is present, forcing the caller to pass `alpha` explicitly | Never silently wrong, but breaks FR4's promise for a caller who has no opinion on `alpha` and just wants the default path to work |
| Automatically switch layer and warn (chosen) | `alpha` defaults to a fixed value, a warning is logged, `ask()` still returns | Never silently violates the constraint, never blocks the caller who wants the simple path; costs a small amount of "spooky action": the effective strategy for a given call depends on the search space's contents, not only on that call's own arguments |

## Trade-off analysis

A raised error is honest but actively defeats FR4's own goal (a caller with no opinion on
tuning should still get a good, working default); silently ignoring the constraint is worse in
every way, since it produces wrong answers without saying so. The switch-and-warn is the only
option that keeps FR4's promise (`ask()` still works with no arguments) without breaking the
promise a `NonlinearConstraint` itself makes (returned candidates satisfy it).

## Consequences

- `ask()`'s behavior for a given `(n_points, alpha)` pair is not fully determined without also
  knowing the search space's constraints; this is documented on `ask()` itself (section 5.7),
  not left implicit.
- `DEFAULT_ALPHA_WHEN_FORCED` is a named constant, not a number buried in the switch logic, so
  it is easy to find and reconsider later.
- Every switch is logged at `WARNING` level through the standard `logging` module (section
  10's own rule), never printed, never silent.

## Action items

1. [x] Implement the search-space check and the forced switch in `BayesianOptimizer.ask()`,
   Phase 2, alongside the custom acquisition layer it depends on.
2. [x] Add a test asserting the warning fires exactly when `alpha=None` and a
   `NonlinearConstraint` is present, and never otherwise
   (`tests/unit/api/test_bayesian_optimizer.py::TestNonlinearConstraintSwitch`).
3. [x] Add `examples/nonlinear_constraint.py` demonstrating both the constraint and the switch.
4. [ ] Revisit `DEFAULT_ALPHA_WHEN_FORCED = 0.0` with the Phase 2 evidence below.

## Phase 2 status and evidence on the forced default

Implemented as decided. The one thing the implementation measured that bears on the decision
is the value of the forced default. On a toy problem (maximize `x + y` subject to
`x * y ** 2 <= 50`, 10 evaluations, 6 seeds, true optimum 12.24), pure exploitation often
stalls, re-suggesting an already-evaluated point because the posterior-mean maximum sits on it:

| `alpha` | mean best | runs reaching the optimum | mean repeated suggestions per run |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.0 | 10.93 | 2 / 6 | 0.8 |
| 0.1 | 10.95 | 3 / 6 | 2.0 |
| 0.3 | 12.24 | 6 / 6 | 2.7 |
| 0.5 | 12.24 | 6 / 6 | 0.2 |

On a different problem (a 6-dimensional mixed search space, no nonlinear constraint, 18
evaluations, 4 seeds) `alpha = 0.0` was the best setting and larger values were worse
(`alpha=0.0`: 0.344, `0.1`: 0.450, `0.3`: 0.498, Ax default: 0.333; optimum about 0.25). So
the best value is problem-dependent and small samples were used; this is evidence to weigh,
not a recommendation to change the constant. It is a named constant precisely so that it is
easy to revisit.
