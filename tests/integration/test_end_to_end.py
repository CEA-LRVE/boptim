"""End-to-end integration test: the full `tell`/`ask`/`save`/`load` loop on a
dummy objective, against a real `AxBackend`.

Requires a real `ax-platform` (and therefore `botorch`/`gpytorch`/`torch`)
install; skipped otherwise, so the rest of the suite still runs without the
full ML stack. Exercises real Ax generation-strategy fitting, so it is
slower than the unit tests, which mostly use `FakeBackend` or avoid the Ax
import entirely.
