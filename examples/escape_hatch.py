"""`axClient` and `fitModel()` used directly (FR16, ADR-0005).

Demonstrates the two escape hatches `BayesianOptimizer` exposes for anything
its high-level facade does not cover (design philosophy #2, section 1.3):

- `axClient`: the live `ax.api.client.Client` instance backing this optimizer.
  Section 4.7 lists several real Ax features boptim's facade does not wrap yet
  (closed-loop `run_trials`, `attach_baseline`, `StorageConfig`, ...); any of
  them is reachable through this property. This script calls
  `get_next_trials` directly on it, chosen because its signature is
  well-confirmed against Ax's own API reference, so this example stays
  correct and runnable regardless of which section-4.7 feature Phase 2/3
  eventually wrap natively.
- `fitModel()`: the current fitted BoTorch surrogate model, for writing and
  optimizing a custom acquisition function directly with BoTorch and feeding
  the result back through `tell()`, without needing Phase 2's `alpha` dial.
