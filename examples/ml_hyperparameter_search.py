"""Hyperparameter search for a model, with the exploration/exploitation dial.

This is the opposite of `lab_experiment.py`: evaluations are cheap enough to run
several in parallel (a batch per round), and there are many more of them, so the
interesting question is how to *spend* them. Demonstrates:

- `ask(n_points=..., alpha=...)` (FR5, FR10): a batch of candidates chosen
  jointly, where `alpha` is the exploration/exploitation trade-off. Here it is
  lowered round by round, one common pattern. The best setting is problem
  dependent: measure before trusting any schedule, including this one. On this
  toy surface, low `alpha` worked best, and `ask()` without `alpha` (Ax's own
  strategy) is a strong baseline to compare against.
- A mixed search space: a log-scaled real (learning rate), an integer (depth),
  an ordered choice (batch size), a categorical (optimizer) and a *conditional*
  parameter (momentum only exists for SGD, through `dependent_parameters`, FR14).
- `ask()` before there is enough data for a model: the first rounds are
  space-filling, then the surrogate model takes over automatically.

Run with:
    uv run python examples/ml_hyperparameter_search.py
