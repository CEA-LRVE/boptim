"""A feasibility constraint that is not linear: `NonlinearConstraint` (FR17).

Sizing a pipe: choose a flow rate and a diameter to maximize throughput per unit
of pipe cost, subject to a limit on the pressure drop. The pressure drop grows
with the square of the flow and falls steeply with the diameter, which no linear
constraint can express:

    flow ** 2 / diameter ** 4 <= 2.0

Ax's own `parameter_constraints` are linear only, so boptim enforces this one in
its own acquisition layer (ADR-0006). Demonstrates:

- Declaring the constraint as an expression string, so the study still saves and
  reloads like any other (FR11).
- The automatic switch: `ask()` with no `alpha` would normally use Ax's own
  strategy, which cannot enforce this constraint, so boptim switches to its own
  layer and logs a warning saying so. Passing `alpha` explicitly is the way to
  choose the exploration/exploitation trade-off yourself, and it silences the
  warning.
- That every suggested point satisfies the constraint.

Run with:
    uv run python examples/nonlinear_constraint.py
