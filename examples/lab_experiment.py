"""A physical-experiment campaign: a small, extremely costly budget.

This is section 1.1's flagship scenario: a handful of evaluations total (think
4-5), each one so expensive (on the order of EUR 1,000,000) that no single
suggested point can be "wasted" on uninformed exploration.

Demonstrates:

- `initialization_budget=0` on `AxBackend` (section 4.4): no evaluation is spent
  on a random, space-filling design; the study is seeded entirely through
  `tell()` instead.
- Manual injection of prior data via `tell()` (FR3).
- `ask()` using Ax's own no-manual-tuning default strategy (FR4). Phase 2 adds
  `alpha`-controlled exploration/exploitation (FR5); this Phase 1 drop only has
  the default path, so `ask()` is called here with no `alpha` argument.
- `predict()` with calibrated uncertainty (FR7, FR8).
- `parameterImportance()` (FR6).
- `save()`/`load()` (FR11, FR12).

Run with:
    uv run python examples/lab_experiment.py
