#: Defaults of the hit-and-run sampler that draws points inside a linear polytope (see
#: `sampleFeasibleEncoded`). They are the only two knobs of that Markov chain. BoTorch's own
#: defaults (burn-in 10000, thinning 32) are much more expensive, and these lower values were
#: chosen from two measurements rather than from theory:
#:
#: - `n_burnin`: steps discarded before the first kept point (the chain starts at an arbitrary
#:   interior point and must forget it). On a simplex, whose exact law is known, 200 and 10000
#:   gave indistinguishable means and variances in 3 and 10 dimensions, so the cheaper value
#:   is used.
#: - `n_thinning`: steps between two kept points (consecutive states are correlated). This is
#:   the expensive knob: on an equality-constrained mixed problem, 32 instead of 10 made
#:   suggesting 3 points 2.7 times slower. The price of 10 is more correlated samples in high
#:   dimension (lag-1 autocorrelation 0.76 in 10 dimensions, against 0.43 with 32). The
#:   samples only seed the optimizer's restarts and normalize the acquisition terms, so this
#:   was judged acceptable; raise it for a high-dimensional polytope.

    """Draws `n` encoded points that satisfy every constraint.

    Without constraints these are plain scrambled-Sobol points. With linear
    constraints the draws come from BoTorch's polytope sampler (so an equality
    such as a mixture summing to one is met exactly, which rejection sampling
    could never do). Nonlinear constraints are then met by rejection, oversampling
    until `n` points survive.

    Used for the alpha layer's reference set, its cold-start (no model yet)
    suggestions, and as the source of feasible starting points for constrained
    optimization.

    Args:
        encoder: The search space encoder.
        constraints: The encoded constraints.
        n: Number of points wanted.
        seed: Seed of the draws.
        snap: Whether to round points onto valid values. Leave `False` for
            continuous relaxations.
        tolerance: Constraint violation accepted (see `EncodedConstraints`).
        n_burnin: Burn-in steps of the polytope sampler, used only when the space has
            linear constraints. See `DEFAULT_POLYTOPE_BURN_IN`.
        n_thinning: Thinning of the polytope sampler, used only when the space has
            linear constraints. See `DEFAULT_POLYTOPE_THINNING`.

    Returns:
        A tensor of shape `(n, d)`. If fewer than `n` distinct feasible points
        were found, the ones found are repeated to fill it.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if no feasible point could be found at all (the feasible
            region may be empty, or too small to hit by sampling).
