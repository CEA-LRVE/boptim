class AlphaAcquisitionStrategy(AcquisitionStrategy):
    """Chooses candidates by maximizing `ExplorationExploitationAcquisition`
    (or its multi-objective variant) over the encoded search space. FR5, FR10,
    FR17.

    Which acquisition function is used follows the `Objective` (design
    philosophy #3, one concept for N = 1 and N > 1):

    - One metric: `ExplorationExploitationAcquisition`, in that metric's
      direction.
    - Several metrics with explicit `weights`: the weights express a scalar
      preference, exactly as `toAxOptimizationConfig` turns them into a weighted
      sum for Ax. The same single-objective class is used on the weighted sum
      of the (direction-signed) metrics.
    - Several metrics, no weights: `MultiObjectiveExplorationExploitationAcquisition`
      (hypervolume improvement).

    A batch is built sequentially: each chosen point is passed to the
    acquisition function as pending (fantasized) before the next is optimized,
    so points are neither copies of one another nor independent of one another.

    Search-space handling:

    - Unordered choices (categorical, boolean) are enumerated with BoTorch's
      `optimize_acqf_mixed`: every combination if there are at most
      `max_categorical_combinations`, otherwise a random subset of that size.
    - Integer ranges, grid ranges and ordered choices are optimized as
      continuous relaxations and rounded afterwards. If rounding breaks a
      constraint, neighbouring roundings are tried, then the best feasible
      random point.
    - `LinearConstraint`s are passed to BoTorch as linear constraints.
      `NonlinearConstraint`s are passed as nonlinear inequality constraints
      with feasible starting points (ADR-0006); every returned candidate is
      checked against all constraints, falling back to the best feasible
      random point if the optimizer's result is not feasible.
    - Conditional parameters (`dependent_parameters`) are optimized as if all
      were active; the inactive ones are dropped from each returned candidate.

    Args:
        num_restarts: Number of optimizer restarts per candidate.
        raw_samples: Number of raw samples used to pick restart points, and the
            size of the feasible fallback pool.
        n_reference_points: Size of the space-filling set the two acquisition
            terms are normalized over.
        n_mc_samples: Number of Monte Carlo samples of the acquisition
            function's joint-posterior term (used once a batch has pending
            points).
        max_categorical_combinations: Cap on enumerated categorical assignments.
        max_iterations: Iteration cap of each optimizer run.
        polytope_burn_in: Burn-in steps of the hit-and-run sampler that draws starting
            points inside linear constraints (only used when there are some). BoTorch's
            own default is 10000. See `DEFAULT_POLYTOPE_BURN_IN`.
        polytope_thinning: Steps between two kept points of that sampler. BoTorch's own
            default is 32. See `DEFAULT_POLYTOPE_THINNING`.
