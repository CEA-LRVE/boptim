    """Compiles each `NonlinearConstraint`'s string expression into the
    tensor-taking callable BoTorch's `optimize_acqf` expects for its
    `nonlinear_inequality_constraints` argument (FR17, ADR-0006).

    BoTorch's convention is that a callable value `>= 0` means feasible, so a
    `">="` constraint `expr >= b` becomes `expr - b` and a `"<="` constraint
    `expr <= b` becomes `b - expr`. Each callable is an intra-point constraint
    (the boolean in each returned pair is `True`): it takes a tensor of shape
    `(..., len(parameter_order))` and returns a tensor of shape `(...)`. BoTorch
    calls it with a single point of shape `(d,)` and gets a scalar tensor
    (differentiable, since BoTorch takes its gradient).

    The callables see parameters' natural values. `parameter_order` fixes which
    tensor column is which parameter, since the callable only sees a tensor,
    not named values.

    Args:
        constraints: The constraints to compile.
        parameter_order: Names of the tensor's columns, in order.
        constants: Optional fixed numeric values (e.g. of `Fixed` parameters)
            an expression may also reference.

    Returns:
        One `(callable, True)` pair per constraint, in order.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if an expression references a name that is neither in
            `parameter_order` nor in `constants`.
