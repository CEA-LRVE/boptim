    """Encodes `trials` for `buildSurrogateModel`.

    Outcomes are in the trials' own (raw) units, one column per metric of
    `objective`, in `objective.metrics` order; the minimize/maximize direction
    is applied later, by the acquisition function.

    Known observation noise is only used when every trial gives a standard
    deviation for every metric: a GP cannot mix fixed and inferred noise, so a
    partial set is ignored (with a warning) rather than half-applied.

    Args:
        encoder: The search space encoder.
        objective: Says which metrics to read from each trial.
        trials: The trial history.

    Returns:
        `(train_x, train_y, train_yvar)` with shapes `(n, d)`, `(n, m)` and
        `(n, m)` (or `None` when noise is inferred).

    Raises:
        ValueError: if a trial lacks a value for one of the objective's metrics
            or a searched parameter.
