    default, and minimized by prepending its name with `"-"`.

    Three cases, matching `Objective`'s own docstring (design philosophy #3:
    single-objective is the N = 1 case of multi-objective, not a separate
    code path):

    - A single metric: `"-loss"` (minimize) or `"loss"` (maximize).
    - Several metrics, `weights=None`: a comma-separated multi-objective
      string, e.g. `"-cost, utility"`, for Pareto optimization with no
      preference between objectives.
    - Several metrics, `weights` set: a single scalarized (weighted-sum)
      objective string, e.g. `"-2.0 * cost + 1.0 * utility"`, where each
      metric's own `minimize` flips the sign of its coefficient.
