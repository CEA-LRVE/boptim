    An `OptimizationBackend.predict` implementation raises this when it cannot
    predict *at this moment* (for `AxBackend`: while Ax's generation strategy
    is still in its initial space-filling phase and holds no model), as opposed
    to being given an invalid point. `BayesianOptimizer.predict` catches it and
    falls back to boptim's own surrogate model; if that cannot be fit either
    (fewer than two completed trials), it raises this error itself, so a caller
    only ever has one exception type to handle.
