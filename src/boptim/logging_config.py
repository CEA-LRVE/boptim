"""Central logging configuration for boptim.

Kept snake_case despite the file otherwise looking like it could be named
after a single symbol: its job is package-wide logging setup (a
`NullHandler` on import, plus an opt-in convenience configurator), not one
class or function meant to be imported and called like a type constructor.
Section 5.1 and section 10 both name this file as the deliberate exception
to the "file name matches its one public symbol" rule.
