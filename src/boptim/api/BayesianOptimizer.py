    """The main entry point. Two ways to call it:

    Common case: `BayesianOptimizer(parameters=[Real(...), Integer(...)])`.
        A single, unnamed metric is assumed; `objective="minimize"` or
        `"maximize"` picks its direction.
    Advanced case: pass an already-built `SearchSpace` (carrying its own
        constraints) and an already-built `Objective` (named metrics,
        optional weights, optional outcome_constraints, single or
        multi-objective). `constraints`/`outcome_constraints` must be left
        `None` in that case (a `ValueError` is raised otherwise: the
        `SearchSpace`/`Objective` already own their own constraints, so
        passing both is an ambiguous request, not a merge).

    No other combination of `parameters`/`objective` is accepted (e.g. a
    plain parameter list together with an already-built `Objective`): the
    two `@overload` signatures above the real `__init__` are the whole
    contract, and the implementation raises a `TypeError` naming exactly
    what was passed for anything outside it, rather than silently guessing
    what a mixed call was supposed to mean.

    `backend` defaults to `AxBackend(random_seed=random_seed)`; injectable
    for testing and for a future non-Ax backend. `acquisition_strategy`
    defaults to `AlphaAcquisitionStrategy()`, the layer behind `ask(alpha=...)`;
    injectable to change how candidates are chosen from the surrogate model
    (FR16).

        strategy chooses (FR4). With `alpha` set, boptim's own acquisition layer
        chooses instead (FR5): it fits a surrogate model on the trial history
        and maximizes a blend of exploitation and exploration weighted by
        `alpha`. Batches (`n_points > 1`) are built one point at a time, each
        chosen point treated as already pending when picking the next (FR10).

        The effective strategy also depends on the search space: if it holds a
        `NonlinearConstraint`, which Ax cannot enforce, then `alpha=None` does
        NOT use Ax's strategy. `ask()` switches to the custom layer with
        `DEFAULT_ALPHA_WHEN_FORCED` (`0.0`, pure exploitation) and logs a
        warning saying so (ADR-0006). Passing `alpha` explicitly never warns.

        With fewer than `MIN_TRIALS_FOR_MODEL` completed trials there is no model
        to consult, so the custom layer suggests space-filling points (that
        still satisfy every constraint).

        The custom layer does not track points it has suggested but that were
        not yet told: asking twice with no `tell()` in between yields different
        points, but not points chosen to complement each other. Ask for a
        batch instead.
