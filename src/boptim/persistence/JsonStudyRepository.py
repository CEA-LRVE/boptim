    temporary file and reading the result back, and `AxBackend.importState`
    is its inverse. `JsonStudyRepository` therefore does not reimplement
    Ax's own serialization (design philosophy #5); it only adds the one JSON
    file boptim's own domain objects (`SearchSpace` with its `default`/
    `dependent_parameters` metadata, `Objective` with its weights, the full
    `Trial` history, `ReproducibilityMetadata`) and the opaque Ax blob live
    in side by side, so a caller gets exactly one file per study (FR11).
