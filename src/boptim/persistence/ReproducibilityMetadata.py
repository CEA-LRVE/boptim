#: in (FR12). Kept as a module-level constant, not buried in a function body,
#: so it is easy to extend if a future phase adds a dependency worth pinning
#: for reproducibility (e.g. `botorch`/`gpytorch` become relevant once the
#: acquisition layer, Phase 2, is in the loop).

    final state, but the random seed, library versions, and creation time.

    Attributes:
        random_seed: The random seed used for this study. Always a concrete
            `int`, even when the caller left `BayesianOptimizer`'s own
            `random_seed` argument as `None`: a seed is generated once and
            recorded here, so a reload is reproducible even for a study that
            never asked for a specific seed.
        library_versions: Maps package name (see `TRACKED_PACKAGES`) to the
            installed version string at the time this study was created, or
            `"not installed"` when a package is absent (e.g. `botorch`/
            `gpytorch` before Phase 2 is wired in).
        created_at: When this study (or, after a reload, this particular
            snapshot) was created, in UTC.
        boptim_version: The installed `boptim` version, duplicated from
            `library_versions` as its own field since it is the single most
            important version to check at a glance.
