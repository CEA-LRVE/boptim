    FR17.

    A string, not a Python callable, specifically so a study using one still
    round-trips through `JsonStudyRepository` (FR11, FR12) like every other
    domain object. It is parsed and evaluated by a small restricted evaluator
    (arithmetic and the short allowlist in
    `validateExpression.ALLOWED_EXPRESSION_FUNCTIONS`), never Python's own
    `eval`.

    No `"="` comparator: an exact nonlinear equality is a measure-zero set a
    numerical optimizer cannot meaningfully target, unlike `LinearConstraint`'s
    `"="`, which BoTorch handles as a true linear equality constraint.

    Not expressible through Ax's own `parameter_constraints` (linear only), so
    `backends/ax` ignores it. It is enforced only by `boptim`'s own acquisition
    layer (`acquisition/toBotorchNonlinearConstraints.py`), which is why
    `BayesianOptimizer.ask()` switches to that layer when one is present
    (ADR-0006).

    The expression is evaluated on the parameters' natural values (not their
    normalized encoding), so `"x ** 2"` means the square of the parameter `x`
    as the caller sees it. Names must refer to numeric parameters; behavior
    where the expression is undefined (e.g. `sqrt` of a negative number, or a
    negative base with a fractional power) is that the point counts as
    infeasible.

    Attributes:
        expression: The left-hand side, over parameter names.
        comparator: `"<="` or `">="`.
        bound: The right-hand side. Must be finite.
