    `result_std`, when known (e.g. from repeated measurements), is passed

    Attributes:
        parameters: Maps parameter name to the value this trial used.
        results: Maps metric name to the observed value.
        result_std: Optionally maps metric name to the known standard

        trial_index: The backend-assigned index of this trial, once it has
            been attached to a backend. `None` for a `Trial` that has not
            been registered with any backend yet.
