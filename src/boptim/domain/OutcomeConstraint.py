    """A constraint on an observed metric rather than on a parameter (e.g.
    `"qps >= 100"`), matching what `Client.configure_optimization`'s own
    `outcome_constraints` expects (FR15). Lives alongside `Objective`, not
    inside `SearchSpace`, because it constrains an observed outcome, not a
    decision variable.

    Attributes:
        metric_name: The name of the constrained metric.
        bound: The right-hand side of the (in)equality.
        comparator: `"<="` or `">="`.
        relative: When `True`, `bound` expresses a multiple of a baseline
            trial rather than an absolute value (e.g. `bound=0.95` with
            `comparator=">="` means "at least 95% of the baseline"). Wiring
            this to `Client.attach_baseline` is listed as deferred in section
            4.7; this field just reserves the shape for it. Using
            `relative=True` requires the caller to have attached a baseline
            trial themselves, e.g. via the `axClient` escape hatch
            (`axClient.attach_baseline(...)`), since boptim does not call
            `attach_baseline` on the caller's behalf in Phase 1.
