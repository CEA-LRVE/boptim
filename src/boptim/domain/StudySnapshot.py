# ReproducibilityMetadata lives under persistence/ (section 5.1's package
# layout), not domain/, since it is a persistence-format concern (FR12)
# rather than a modeling concept an optimization backend needs. Importing it
# here is safe (no import cycle): ReproducibilityMetadata itself has zero
# boptim dependencies, so domain's "zero ML dependencies" rule (section 4.1)
# is preserved in spirit; it is the one deliberate exception to domain/ never
# importing from a sibling top-level package.

class StudySnapshot(BaseModel):
    """Everything needed to fully reconstruct a `BayesianOptimizer`: its
    search space, objective, constraints, trial history, and reproducibility
    metadata. The unit that `persistence/` reads and writes. Wraps, rather
    than duplicates, whatever Ax's own `Client.save_to_json_file` already
    captures; see section 5.6.

    Attributes:
        name: The study's name (mirrors `BayesianOptimizer.__init__`'s own
            `name` argument).
        search_space: The full `SearchSpace`, including any `Constraint`s.
            Kept as boptim's own domain object (not re-derived from
            `backend_state`) so that `default`/`dependent_parameters`
            metadata that Ax's own snapshot does not carry a field for
            round-trips exactly (FR11, FR12).
        objective: The full `Objective`, including weights and
            `OutcomeConstraint`s.
        trials: The complete trial history, in the order they were told to
            the optimizer (FR12: "full trial history ... not just the final
            state").
        reproducibility: The random seed, library versions, and creation
            timestamp recorded alongside the study (FR12).
        backend_state: The backend's own serialized state, opaque to the
            domain layer. For `AxBackend`, this is the JSON object Ax's own
            `Client.save_to_json_file` produces (obtained by writing to a
            temporary file and reading it back, since `Client` only offers a
            file-based save/load API), so that `JsonStudyRepository` can
            round-trip a single boptim file while still delegating the
            Ax-backed portion of persistence to Ax itself (design
            philosophy #5).
        backend_kind: Identifies which backend `backend_state` belongs to
            (`"ax"` in Phase 1). Lets `JsonStudyRepository.load` pick the
            right backend class to restore into.
